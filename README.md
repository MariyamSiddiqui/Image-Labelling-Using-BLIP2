# 🖼️ BLIP-2 Based Image Captioning and Dataset Labeling

This project demonstrates how to use the **BLIP-2 (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)** model for automatic image caption generation and dataset creation. It walks through the complete process — from setting up dependencies and loading images to generating captions and pushing the labeled dataset to the **Hugging Face Hub**.
